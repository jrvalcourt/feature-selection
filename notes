4/28/2020 wrote the code to calculate log of probabilities for arbitrary k and ran it for k=2,4,6,8,10 on A Tale of Two Cities and on all of Dickens' books in the Project Gutenberg collection. Tomorrow will try building markov models, combining local maxima in the log prob trace into words. Sharad seems fixated on when the log ratio drops below zero but I don't know if that happens enough to get reasonably sized words.
